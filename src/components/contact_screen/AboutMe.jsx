      <p>
        Hi, I am Beau Hobba, and I am a mechatronics engineer (and so to be card
        game designer). Roost games was birthed through a shared enjoyment of
        board games with my friends,
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        One casual afternoon, I had the idea to try and photograph and observe
        every creature endemic to Australia. Before I knew it, I found myself
        dedicating a load of time to bird-watching. Birds always took the lead
        on my checklist of animals, and this fondness for our feathered friends
        naturally spilled over into my second loveâ€”board games.
