              When a player calls <b>Roost</b>, all other players get 1 more
              turn. A <b>Roost</b> is only finalised when a player has flipped
              all of their cards face-up. If the next clockwise player is able
              to pick up a new card before they have revealed all their cards
              you get an additional turn. If a player has called <b>Roost</b>,
              no other player can <b>Roost</b>. The player's cards are now
              locked and immune to any abilities (
              <i>

              The player with the lowest score for the round wins. If the player
              who called <b>Roost</b> wins, their final score is reduced by 1.
              If the player who called <b>Roost</b> loses or ties, their final
              score is doubled.
              <br></br>A player automatically <b>Roost</b>s if they have 0 cards
              (and are the first player to have 0 cards)
              <br></br>
              If the deck runs out and no player has <b>Roost</b> the round ends

              The game continues, shuffling the deck with each new round. When a
              player reaches 100 points the game ends<i>**</i>. The player with
              the lowest score ends.
